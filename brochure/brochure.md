# 🧾 Brochure Generator

This project uses an LLM to **generate promotional brochure-style content** for a given website 🌐✨

## 🧠 What it does

- Takes a website URL as input (e.g., a product or startup landing page) 🔗  
- Uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape visible text from the page 🧽  
- Cleans the text and removes unnecessary HTML junk ✂️  
- Sends the cleaned content to a language model (like GPT) 🧠  
- Prompts the model to generate a short, punchy brochure description 📝  
- Outputs the generated brochure directly in the notebook 💡

## 📌 Why this is useful

Writing promotional content is time-consuming. This tool gives you:
- 🧃 Quick drafts of marketing copy  
- 🛠️ Editable outputs for refining tone or length  
- ⚡ A fast way to create landing page blurbs, product intros, or pitch snippets

Perfect for founders, marketers, or devs who want to **turn raw site content into compelling messaging** in seconds.
