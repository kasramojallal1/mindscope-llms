      "Wolf emphasized the importance of safety and transparency in robotics: “Open-source software has proven over time to be more secure.” He highlighted recent security concerns in other robotics platforms, reinforcing why open-source AI models should guide physical machines. There’s also a long-term vision to open-source Reachy’s hardware, enabling people to 3D print parts and modify the robot freely.\n",

      "This move follows Hugging Face’s growing involvement in robotics, including the launch of LeRobot, a robotics code library, and a partnership with\n",
      "NVIDIA\n",
      "in 2025 to host its GR00T N1 model for humanoid robots. With cost-effective solutions like the $100 SO-100 robotic arm, Hugging Face aims to make robotics both fun and functional, bringing AI out of the cloud and into the real world.\n",
