# 🧠 mindscope-llms

Welcome to **mindscope-llms** – a growing collection of hands-on, end-to-end projects that explore the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. Each project in this repo is built to demonstrate how LLMs can be combined with tools, APIs, and techniques to solve practical problems, automate tasks, and build smart systems.

> ⚒️ **Work in progress** – New projects are being added regularly!

## 📁 Project Structure

Each project lives in its own folder and is fully self-contained.  
Inside each directory, you'll find:
- ✅ The full code (usually in a Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts)
- 📄 A dedicated doc file (`.md`) explaining what the project does and how it works

## 🚀 Projects

1. **🧾 Brochure Generator**  
   AI-powered tool that scrapes and summarizes a company’s website to generate a short, professional brochure-style description.

2. **🛫 AI Customer Support Agent**  
   Multi-modal chatbot for an airline with UI integration and function-calling support — built to handle both voice and text queries.

3. **🎧 Meeting Minutes Generator**  
   Converts audio files into structured meeting summaries and action items using both open-source and proprietary LLMs.

4. **⚙️ Python to C++ Code Translator**  
   Converts Python code into optimized C++ and boosts execution speed by up to 60,000× — serious performance gains!

5. **📚 AI Knowledge Worker (RAG-based)**  
   Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that reads and understands all company-related documents to answer questions and provide insights.

6. **💸 Capstone A – Price Prediction (Frontier Models)**  
   Predicts product prices from short product descriptions using powerful commercial LLMs.

7. **🧠 Capstone B – Price Prediction (Open-Source Models)**  
   Fine-tunes open-source models to achieve results close to frontier LLMs — with full control and transparency.

8. **🤖 Capstone C – Autonomous Deal Spotter**  
   An agent-based system that works with LLMs to find great product deals and alert users automatically.
