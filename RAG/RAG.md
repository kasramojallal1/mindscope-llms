# 📚 RAG-Based Knowledge Worker

This project builds a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that turns an LLM into a company knowledge expert 🧠💼

## 🧠 What it does

- Loads and processes a set of company-related documents (PDFs, text, etc.) 📄  
- Splits the content into chunks and creates vector embeddings 📐  
- Stores embeddings in a vector database (e.g., FAISS) for fast retrieval 🚀  
- Accepts user queries and retrieves relevant context 📥  
- Uses an LLM to generate accurate, context-aware answers 💬  

## 🛠️ Concepts in Action

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Combines search + generation for grounded answers  
- **Document Chunking & Embedding**: Makes data searchable and LLM-ready  
- **Vector Search**: Finds the most relevant info before prompting the LLM  
- **Context Injection**: Keeps answers accurate and domain-specific  

## 📌 Use Cases

Perfect for building:
- Internal knowledge bots for employees  
- Smart assistants for customer queries  
- Searchable document Q&A systems
